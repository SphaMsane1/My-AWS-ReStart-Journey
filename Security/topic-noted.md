# Introduction to AWS Security Services

AWS offers a robust suite of security services designed to protect cloud infrastructure, applications, and data. These services help organizations manage identity, detect threats, enforce compliance, and respond to incidentsâ€”all while maintaining agility and scalability in the cloud.

## Key Categories of AWS Security Services

- Identity and Access Management (IAM)

    - IAM enables you to control who can access AWS resources and what actions they can perform. It supports fine-grained permissions, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and role-based access control.

- Data Protection

    - Services like AWS Key Management Service (KMS) and AWS Secrets Manager help encrypt data and securely manage credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information.

- Threat Detection and Monitoring

    - AWS provides tools like Amazon GuardDuty, AWS Security Hub, and Amazon Inspector to detect anomalies, scan for vulnerabilities, and aggregate security findings across services.

- Infrastructure Protection

    - AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) and AWS Shield protect applications from common web exploits and DDoS attacks. These services help secure APIs and web traffic.

- Compliance and Governance

    - AWS Config and AWS Audit Manager assist in tracking resource configurations and ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulations.

## Benefits of AWS Security Services

- End-to-end protection across workloads.

- Automation of security tasks to reduce human error.

- Real-time threat detection and response.

- Built-in compliance support for global standards.
