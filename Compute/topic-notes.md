# Compute services notes

## What are compute services?

AWS Compute Services provide the processing power, memory, and networking resources needed to run applications in the cloud—without managing physical servers. These services are scalable, flexible, and designed to support everything from simple websites to complex enterprise systems.

## Categories of AWS Compute Services

1.Virtual Machines (Instances)
- Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Launch and manage virtual servers with full control over the OS and configuration.

- EC2 Auto Scaling: Automatically adjusts the number of instances based on demand.

- EC2 Spot Instances: Cost-effective option for fault-tolerant workloads.

- Amazon Lightsail: Simplified platform for small apps and websites.

2.Containers
- Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service): Run Docker containers on AWS.

- Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service): Managed Kubernetes clusters.

- AWS Fargate: Serverless compute engine for containers—no need to manage servers.

- Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry): Store and manage container images.

3.Serverless
- AWS Lambda: Run code in response to events without provisioning servers. Pay only for compute time used.

## Key concepts

- Scalability: Automatically scale resources up or down.

- Flexibility: Choose the right compute model for your workload.

- Cost Optimization: Use Savings Plans, Spot Instances, and Compute Optimizer.

- Security: Built-in features like IAM, VPC, and encryption.

- Global Reach: Deploy applications across multiple regions and availability zones.

## Reflection

Exploring AWS Compute Services reveals how cloud computing has revolutionized the way we build and scale applications. From traditional virtual machines like EC2 to modern serverless options like Lambda, AWS offers a spectrum of solutions tailored to diverse workloads. The flexibility to choose between full control, container orchestration, or event-driven execution empowers developers and businesses to optimize for performance, cost, and agility.
